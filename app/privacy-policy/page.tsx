<p>4. Sharing & Disclosure of Information
We do not sell or rent your personal data to third parties. We may share information in these limited circumstances:

Service Providers: We employ trusted third-party companies (e.g., cloud hosting, AI providers) to facilitate our Service. They only access data to perform tasks on our behalf and are bound by confidentiality.
Legal Requirements: We may disclose personal information if required by law or to protect our rights, investigate fraud, or respond to a lawful request.

If you request account deletion, we will remove or anonymize your data within a reasonable timeframe, subject to legal obligations.
</p>
<p>6. Security Measures
We take reasonable precautions to protect your information:

Encryption: We use encryption (e.g., HTTPS) to protect data transmitted between our apps and servers.
Access Controls: We limit access to personal data to employees and contractors who need it to operate, develop, or improve our Service, all under strict confidentiality.
However, no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed 100% secure. You use our Service at your own risk.
